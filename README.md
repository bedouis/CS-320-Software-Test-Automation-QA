#### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I follow best practices especially in terms of securing my code. I also follow the requirements and run code to ensure that my software functions as expected. Testing allows to check the program against cases where its functionality might be broken if some requirements are not met.
#### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are translated into software requirements and structured in software requirements document. To incorporate them into a program, we need to start by writing tests derived from those requirements, and then write code that can pass these tests.
#### How do I approach designing software?
I gather requirements and avoid start coding right from the beginning. I start by analyzing requirement and design the software through defiierent tools such as UML diagrans. These tools help drawing a clearer picture of what is needed and then coding will flow more logically following the software requirements.
